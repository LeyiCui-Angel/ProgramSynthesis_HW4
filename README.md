# ProgramSynthesis_HW4

I had difficulties using rosette after installation. So I spent a lot of time working on solving dependencies.

I played around with rosette to check all possible lists of length 10 containing integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive) to find a list that satisfies the constraints. 
- The length of the array is 10.
- The array contains only integers between 0 and 100.
- The sum of all the even numbers in the array is 42.
